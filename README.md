# Ans extra time worker

This process sets enables and disables extra time in Ans based on a SIS query.
Configure the `Ans` and `Sis` sections in the config with the correct details and run the app.

The configured SIS account needs to have access to a query called `Q_OH_AAN_EXTRA_TIJD` that returns students ids of students with extra time.
